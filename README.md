# Homer

Last year I started to connect various systems in my home, made a simple POC in the form of a Python based application that was both a API and a web page to control the system. Later on it expanded to a third system in the "cloud" that internet based services pushed messages to.

The code is messy, you can check it out here [autohome](https://github.com/nsg/autohome).

## Rust

Rust has been on my list-of-things-to-learn for some time, and autohome is messy and has been on my need-to-be-rewritten list ... so, why not combine these two?

I will probably split homer in several parts.
